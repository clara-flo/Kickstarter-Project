# üìä 1. Overall Performance & Success Rates

## üßø Calculate the overall success rate

```sql
-- Calculate the overall success rate
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS total_projects,
  SUM(CASE WHEN col10 = 'successful' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS successful_projects,
  ROUND(
    SUM(CASE WHEN col10 = 'successful' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 
    2
  ) AS success_rate_percent
FROM
  projects;
```

### üìä  Answer 

| total\_projects | successful\_projects | success\_rate\_percent |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 704585          | 249765                | 35.45                  |

## üßø   Success rate by main category and category 

```sql
SELECT
  col4 AS main_category,
  col3 AS category,
  COUNT(*) AS total_projects,
  SUM(CASE WHEN col10 = 'successful' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS successful_projects,
  ROUND(
    SUM(CASE WHEN col10 = 'successful' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 
    2
  ) AS success_rate_percent
FROM
  projects
GROUP BY
  col4, col3
ORDER BY
  success_rate_percent DESC;
```


### üìä  Answer: Three most successful 

| main\_category | category       | total\_projects | successful\_projects | success\_rate\_percent |
| -------------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Music          | Chiptune | 57            | 43                 | 75.44                  |
| Comics            | Anthologies    | 761            | 568                  | 74.64                  |
| Dance     | Residencies      | 98             | 67                  | 68.37                  |

## üßø   Average amount pledged by project state 

```sql
SELECT
  col10 AS project_state,
  COUNT(*) AS total_projects,
  ROUND(
    AVG(col9),
    2) AS avg_pledged
FROM
  projects
GROUP BY
  col10
ORDER BY
  total_projects DESC;
```

### üìä  Answer 


| project\_state | total\_projects | avg\_pledged |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| failed         | 367,629         | 1,409.64     |
| successful     | 249,765         | 24,349.05    |
| canceled       | 71,830          | 2,513.16     |
| live           | 5,320           | 9,539.46     |
| suspended      | 3,378           | 9,386.40     |


### üí°  What we learn 

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£  Successful vs. Failed: Huge difference 

*  Successful projects  raise  \~24,000 USD  on average.
*  Failed projects  raise only  \~1,400 USD  on average.
* ‚Üí Clear evidence that there‚Äôs a big gap: projects that get traction often get *much* more than the minimum goal, while most failed projects struggle to get off the ground.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£  Canceled projects: Mid-range 

* Average for  canceled  projects is  \~2,500 USD  ‚Äî higher than failed ones but way below successful ones.
*  Possible reasons: 

  * Creators often  cancel their own projects  if they see they‚Äôre unlikely to succeed.
  * Sometimes they relaunch with better strategy/goal.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£  Live projects: promising but incomplete 

*  Live  projects are still raising money ‚Üí they average  \~9,500 USD  so far.
* Some will likely succeed, others might fail.
* So their average sits between failed and successful: *in progress*.


#### 4Ô∏è‚É£  Suspended projects: unusual 

* Suspended means Kickstarter  stopped the project  ‚Äî e.g. policy violations, fraud, or errors.
* Their average pledged is  \~9,300 USD  ‚Äî often suspicious because suspicious projects sometimes raise a surprising amount before being flagged.

### üîë  Key takeaway 

This pattern is typical of crowdfunding:

* There‚Äôs a clear  threshold effect : once a project reaches a certain momentum, backers pile on ‚Üí large pledges.
*  Failed and canceled projects  often stay small ‚Üí they don‚Äôt build trust or attract enough backers.
* It is important to  Advice for creators  since realistic goals and good promotion are key to crossing the funding line.

## üßø   Proportion of projects exceeding their fundraising goal, and by how much


```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS total_projects, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN col9 >= col7 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS projects_exceeded_goal,
  ROUND(
    SUM(CASE WHEN col9 >= col7 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100,
    2) AS percent_exceeded_goal,

  ROUND(
    AVG(CASE WHEN col9 >= col7 THEN (col9- col7)/col7 * 100 ELSE NULL END) ,
    2
  ) AS avg_percent_over_goal
FROM
  projects; 
```


### üìä Answer

| total\_projects | projects\_exceeded\_goal | percent\_exceeded\_goal |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 704,585         | 255,539                  | 36.27%                  |

| avg\_percent\_over\_goal |
| ------------------------ |
| 769.20%                  |

### üí°  What we learn 
* Success takes work, but once momentum builds, it often **exceeds expectations**.

* The **average percent over goal** is \~**770%**. This means that on average, these over-goal projects raise **8.7√ó** their original target. This is because many creators set *low, reachable goals* to guarantee they get funded ‚Äî once backers pile in, total funding often grows far beyond the original goal.

# üìÖ 2. Time-based Trends

## üßø   Success rate by year
```sql
SELECT
  YEAR(col8) AS launch_year,
  COUNT(*) AS total_projects,
  SUM(CASE WHEN col10 = 'successful' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS successful_projects,
  ROUND(
    SUM(CASE WHEN col10 = 'successful' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100,
    2
  ) AS success_rate_percent
FROM
  projects
GROUP BY
  launch_year
ORDER BY
  launch_year DESC;

### üí°  What we learn 

‚úÖ **1Ô∏è‚É£ Early years ‚Üí high success rates**

* From 2009 to 2012, the success rate hovered around **43‚Äì46%**, meaning nearly **half** of projects reached their goal.
* Why? Kickstarter was newer, fewer projects, more ‚Äúearly adopters‚Äù who were deeply supportive.
* There was *less competition*, and backers trusted the novelty.

‚úÖ **2Ô∏è‚É£ Massive growth ‚Üí lower success rates**

* By 2013‚Äì2014, the number of projects exploded (83k ‚Üí 126k ‚Üí 143k in 2015).
* But success rate **dropped** from \~43% to \~27% by 2015.
* More creators launched projects, but audience attention didn‚Äôt scale linearly ‚Üí competition for backers increased.


‚úÖ **3Ô∏è‚É£ Recent years stay lower**

* After the big peak in 2015, volume slightly shrank (106k in 2016, 96k in 2017).
* The success rate stabilized around **32‚Äì35%**, lower than the early years but not falling off a cliff.
* By 2017, about 1 in 3 projects succeeded ‚Äî not bad, but much tougher than Kickstarter‚Äôs early ‚Äúgold rush.‚Äù

#### üîë Key takeaway 

* Kickstarter‚Äôs early years had **fewer but more successful projects** ‚Äî novelty, loyal backers, less noise.
* As the platform scaled, **competition increased**, and creators needed better marketing, planning, and community.
* The success rate leveling off around 30‚Äì35% shows the platform *matured* into a competitive crowdfunding marketplace.

```

### üìä Answer

| launch\_month | total\_projects | successful\_projects | success\_rate\_percent |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 3 (March)     | 63,192          | 23,694               | 37.50%                 |

### üí°  What we learn 

* The **range is about 8%** (37.5% ‚Üí 29.5%).
* So seasonality exists, but it‚Äôs moderate. Good timing helps ‚Äî but strong ideas & marketing matter more.
* If you want to **maximize success odds**, launching in **spring or early fall** is statistically slightly better.
* Avoid **late summer** & **December** if you can ‚Äî backers are distracted.

## üßø   Duration of the campaign
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN DATEDIFF(col6, col8) <= 14 THEN 'Short (<=2 weeks)'

### üìä Answer

| duration\_group        | total\_projects | success\_rate\_percent |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Short (<=2 weeks)      | 25,430          | 48.35%                 |

| Very Long (61‚Äì90 days) | 9,198           | 34.45%                 |
| Ultra Long (>90 days)  | 939             | 28.22%                 |

### üí°  What we learn 

‚úÖ **1Ô∏è‚É£ Short campaigns succeed *much more often***

* Projects with a **duration of 2 weeks or less** have a **48% success rate** ‚Äî far above the dataset average.
* Why? Short campaigns create *urgency*: backers feel they must pledge now or miss out.
* Also, short campaigns often have strong pre-launch promotion ‚Äî they know their audience.

‚úÖ **2Ô∏è‚É£ The standard 15‚Äì30 day range still works well**

* The biggest bucket by far ‚Äî **418k projects** ‚Äî shows a healthy **35.6% success rate**.
* This aligns with Kickstarter‚Äôs recommended \~30-day run time: enough time to gather momentum without losing urgency.


‚úÖ **3Ô∏è‚É£ Longer campaigns don‚Äôt help ‚Äî they *hurt***

* **31‚Äì60 days**: success rate drops to **33.9%**.
* **61‚Äì90 days**: about the same (34.4%).
* **Over 90 days**: success rate falls to **28%**.
* Longer campaigns lose steam ‚Äî backers get bored, promotion costs go up, momentum fades.
