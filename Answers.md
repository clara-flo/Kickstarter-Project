### ðŸ§¿ ** Calculate the overall success rate**

```sql
-- Calculate the overall success rate
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS total_projects,
  SUM(CASE WHEN col10 = 'successful' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS successful_projects,
  ROUND(
    SUM(CASE WHEN col10 = 'successful' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 
    2
  ) AS success_rate_percent
FROM
  projects;
```

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Explanation**

* `COUNT(*)` â†’ total number of projects in the dataset.
* `SUM(CASE WHEN col10 = 'successful' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` â†’ counts only projects where the **state** is `'successful'` (in your table, thatâ€™s `col10`).
* `ROUND(..., 2)` â†’ gives you the percentage success rate with 2 decimals.
