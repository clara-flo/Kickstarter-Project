# üìä KICKSTARTER PROJECTS ANALYSIS

On this project, I am going to study data from Kickstarter, one of the largest crowdfunding platforms where creators launch projects and seek financial support directly from the public. The dataset used for this analysis comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kemical/kickstarter-projects) and contains thousands of real Kickstarter projects, including information such as project names, categories, goals, pledged amounts, currencies, countries, deadlines, and final outcomes (successful or failed).

By exploring this data, I aim to uncover trends, patterns, and factors that can help explain why some projects succeed while others do not. The insights gained can support creators in designing better campaigns, guide backers in making informed pledging decisions, and contribute to a deeper understanding of how crowdfunding shapes innovation and creative industries.


### üöÄ I will adress the following topics: 

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Understand what drives success:**

* What categories (e.g., Technology, Film, Games) succeed more often?
* How do funding goals, launch timing, and project duration affect outcomes?
* What‚Äôs the impact of country or currency?

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Spot trends and patterns:**

* How have success rates changed over time?
* Are certain months or seasons more favorable for launching campaigns?
* Do global events influence crowdfunding behavior?

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Predict and improve outcomes:**

* Creators can learn how to set realistic goals.
* They can optimize launch strategies based on evidence, not guesswork.
* Backers can better identify viable projects.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Support business and research decisions:**

* Marketers and entrepreneurs can explore how crowdfunding fits into bigger product development pipelines.
* Social scientists and economists can study collective funding behavior and global collaboration trends.
